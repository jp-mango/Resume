			<h2>About Me:</h2>
			<p>
				I'm Justin Menzies, and I'm passionate about all things tech. I've
				developed my career as an IT professional, leveraging my passion for
				computer systems and technology. Currently, I'm furthering my knowledge
				by pursuing a degree in Cloud Computing at Western Governors University,
				where I'm diving deep into the dynamic world of cloud technology. Beyond
				my professional and academic life, I'm a tech enthusiast at heart. I
				have my own home lab where I love to tinker with various technologies
				within Proxmox and my home network. In my downtime, I'm also an avid
				gamer. I appreciate the challenges it brings and the sense of
				camaraderie that gaming communities offer. One of my unique interests is
				building and customizing mechanical keyboards. Crafting the perfect
				setup is a satisfying blend of creativity and innovation. Additionally,
				I enjoy home automation and find satisfaction in the convenience and
				efficiency it brings to everyday life. If you're in search of a
				tech-savvy professional with a genuine passion for technology and a
				commitment to continuous learning,
				<a href="mailto:menziesjustin923@gmail.com">connect with me.</a>
				I'm eager to explore how my skills and experience align with your needs,
				and to learn more along the way. Thank you for visiting, and I'm excited
				about the potential opportunities we can explore together.
